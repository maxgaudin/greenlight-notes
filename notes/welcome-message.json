{"title":"Welcome to Notes!","message":"This feature allows you to take notes anywhere on Greenlight!\n\nWe've included a text editor so that you can make your messages **bold**, _italic_, or style your `code snippets` to look like real code, like this:\n\n```\nfunction helloWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello World!');\n}\n```\n\nYou can even edit or delete notes with the icons at the top right of this window. Try hitting the green edit icon above to see how we're styling the text in this note.\n\nWhen you're ready to start writing your own notes hit the `green + icon` in the bottom left corner!","id":"welcome-message","date":"2018-02-02T21:19:22.618Z"}
